Abstract
Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic
leadership and technological innovation.
Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply
when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and
upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that
scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and
technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative
framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline
an agenda for future research.
Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning
overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important
aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors,
incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership,
into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays
in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars
and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research.
Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better
understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and
technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of
the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders
and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive
selection and compensation.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Scholars have long sought to understand technological innovation
(Ahuja, Lampert, & Tandon, 2008; Dosi, 1982; Schumpeter, 1942;
Teece, 1996), which can be broadly defined as changes in the
ways value is created and captured in a given field
(Damanpour, 1987; Hill & Rothaermel, 2003). Such changes include
both discontinuous technological breakthroughs and incremental
progress (Anderson & Tushman, 1990; Dewar & Dutton, 1986).
Technological innovation is vital for the survival of companies
because, without it, firms are unlikely to generate a sustainable
competitive advantage (Hill & Rothaermel, 2003; Tripsas &
Gavetti, 2000). The ability to adopt technologies is particularly
important considering today's rapid technical advances, which in

turn trigger grand challenges and opportunities (Tidd &
Bessant, 2018).
Not surprisingly, given the key role of technological innovation,
researchers have increasingly focused on the impact of strategic
leaders—those executives who, as members of the board of directors
or the top management team (TMT), are particularly influential
(Finkelstein, Hambrick, & Cannella, 2009). Upper echelons theory suggests
that strategic leaders affect organizational outcomes in general
and innovation in particular (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), especially
because they influence organizational attention, resource commitment,
strategic choices, and implementation strategies (Carpenter,
Geletkanycz, & Sanders, 2004; Gerstner, König, Enders, &
Hambrick, 2013; Kaplan, 2008a). In this vein, researchers in various
disciplines, including corporate governance (e.g., Rose, Rose, Norman,
& Mazza, 2014), strategic management (e.g., Kor, 2006), finance
(e.g., Ammann, Horsch, & Oesch, 2016), and entrepreneurship
(e.g., Gedajlovic, Cao, & Zhang, 2012), have studied the relationship
between strategic leaders and innovation, creating a need to consolidate
the current state of knowledge.
Scholars have conducted valuable reviews in the field of innovation,
including reviews of literature on the role of leadership. However,
the limited reach of these reviews has ramifications for the
analytic, predictive, and normative potential of research in this
domain. Three limitations are particularly noteworthy. First, several
broad reviews of the innovation literature identify managerial characteristics
as one of several antecedents of technological innovation
(Ahuja, Lampert, & Tandon, 2008) or technological discontinuities
(Eggers & Park, 2018), but they hardly discuss the paths of influence.
Second, some reviews offer outdated and incomplete overviews of
the relevant characteristics of strategic leaders. For example, Crossan
and Apaydin (2010) investigated the impact of the board and theTMT
on innovation. However, that review is a decade old and only captures
a small subset of the relevant characteristics of strategic leaders.
Third, some reviews only link certain strategic leaders with
specific innovation outcomes. For example, Back and Bausch (2019)
examined the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) leadership on
various firm-level antecedents of product innovation, such as social
capital. Yet they do not consider a substantial number of studies that
directly link CEO characteristics to technological innovation more
broadly, and they do not consider strategic leaders other than the
CEO. As such, no comprehensive review on strategic leadership
and technological innovation is available, making it difficult for
scholars to build on previous findings and identify relevant research
questions.
Our review fills this gap. We aim to answer four interrelated
questions: (1) What are the main theoretical lenses that scholars
have applied when exploring the relationship between strategic
leadership and technological innovation? (2) Which constructs and
measures of technological innovation have scholars combined with
certain facets of strategic leadership? (3) How are the characteristics
of strategic leaders empirically related to different aspects of
innovation? and (4) What are potentially fruitful avenues for future
research?
2 | METHOD
To ensure a comprehensive account of the literature, we conducted a
systematic review (e.g., David & Han, 2004; Rousseau, Manning, &
Denyer, 2008). Given the multidisciplinary nature of the domain, we
first identified 35 relevant peer-reviewed journals from different
fields. These included the 30 outlets used in Wowak et al.'s (2017)
recent review of incentives in strategic leadership. To specifically capture
corporate-governance aspects, we also included a leading journal
focused on that topic. In addition, owing to the focus of this review,
we included two journals concerned with innovation, which two innovation
scholars confirmed were the most important in the field.
Finally, we included two major journals dealing with family firms, as
family firms are one of the most prevalent firm types (La Porta,
Lopez-De-Silanes, & Shleifer, 1999; Lodh, Nandy, & Chen, 2014).
Moreover, family ownership and family involvement in strategic decision
making substantially affect firms' technological innovation
(De Massis, Frattini, & Lichtenthaler, 2013; Lodh, Nandy, &
Chen, 2014). In fact, as De Massis et al. (2013, p. 10) noted, “there are
strong theoretical reasons to believe that the antecedents and effects
of technological innovation are different in family and nonfamily firms.”
Again, we validated our selection with two family business scholars.
Table 1 provides an overview of the journals included in our review.
Using the above-mentioned definitions of strategic leadership
and technological innovation as our conceptual anchors, we created a
list of keywords. To validate our selection of keywords, we discussed
them with management and innovation scholars and consulted
scholars from economics and finance. These discussions led to the
addition of a few keywords to our initial list. Table 2 shows the final
list of keywords used in our literature search.
We set the review's starting point to 1984 to cover all literature
published after Hambrick and Mason's (1984) seminal paper, which
highlighted the importance of strategic leaders for organizational outcomes
and laid the foundations for upper echelons theory. We then
identified an initial sample of 937 articles published before the end of
2019 using the Web of Science database.
We read all articles' abstracts and, if necessary, their main texts
and retained those articles that fulfilled two criteria. First, each article
had to examine strategic leaders (i.e., boards of directors, CEOs, other
TMT members, and/or business unit heads) (Finkelstein, Hambrick, &
Cannella, 2009). Second, each article had to focus on technological
innovation (Damanpour, 1987). We removed articles in which the
hypotheses or propositions were not related to both criteria. Moreover,
we removed articles dealing with young firms and start-ups
owing to the specific context in which these firms and their strategic
leaders operate (e.g., Park & Tzabbar, 2016).
Overall, we retained 158 articles and systematically coded each
article for central theoretical and methodological aspects. For example,
we examined the theoretical lens(es) that each study applied as
well as the methodological approaches and the results. Table A1 in
Data S1 summarizes the studies we reviewed.
In line with the growing importance of technological innovation
for organizations (Tidd & Bessant, 2018), the number of studies on

strategic leadership and technological innovation rose over time. As
Figure 1 shows, only one-third of the identified studies were published
between 1984 and 2009, although the number of articles grew
substantially in the last decade.
An analysis of the studies' research approaches and geographical
focus reveals other interesting insights, which are summarized in
Table 3. First, most studies employed a quantitative research
approach, usually based on archival data or, to a lesser extent, surveys.
Few studies used qualitative research methods, such as case studies,
or employed experimental or conceptual approaches. In addition,
many of the empirical studies focused on the United States, followed
by a focus on multicountry datasets. Little research investigated individual
countries other than the United States, with China being a distant
second.

3 | AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK ON
STRATEGIC LEADERS AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION
A framework that aggregates the findings from our analysis is shown
in Figure 2. We employ a strategic leadership perspective, which
assumes that strategic leaders' cognitive bases and values affect innovation
through a filtering process (Finkelstein, Hambrick, &
Cannella, 2009; Hambrick & Mason, 1984). By extension, we
acknowledge that firm leaders may be affected by firm characteristics,
and we also consider such relationships.
Our framework displays the main theoretical lenses used by
scholars. Moreover, it includes the key individual-level and group-level
characteristics of strategic leaders engaged with technological innovation.
We distinguish between board and TMT characteristics, and we
split the constructs into those focused on these groups as a whole
and those focused on individual members of the board or TMT. Owing
to the prominent role of the CEO in organizations (Finkelstein,
Hambrick, & Cannella, 2009), we review CEO characteristics separately.
We link strategic leaders' characteristics to the major
innovation-related constructs. First, we consider innovation input, such
as research and development (R&D) intensity (e.g., Cremers, Litov, &
Sepe, 2017). Second, we consider innovation output, such as patents
(e.g., Custódio, Ferreira, & Matos, 2019). Third, given the challenges
of transforming innovation input into output (Duran, Kammerlander,
van Essen, & Zellweger, 2016), we consider the relationship between
strategic leaders' characteristics and the innovation process, such as
product development (e.g., Swink, 2000). Fourth, we look at strategic
leadership and aspects of the intraorganizational innovation context,
such as a firm's innovation orientation (e.g., Carmeli & Halevi, 2009).
Finally, our framework depicts the consequences of the relationship
between strategic leadership and technological innovation for firm
performance and describes moderating environmental and organizational
factors. All in all, we strive to provide a concise overview of the
extant knowledge and to highlight gaps in that knowledge.
3.1 | Main theoretical lenses
Figure 3 summarizes our findings regarding the main theoretical
lenses. Upper echelons theory (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) is the most
widely used theory (37 articles). Most scholars using this theory examine
the impact of CEO and group-level TMT characteristics on innovation
(e.g., Barker & Mueller, 2002; Talke, Salomo, & Kock, 2011). Few
studies focus on the board or individual TMT members other than the
CEO (Garms & Engelen, 2019; Kor, 2006; Shi, Pathak, Song, &
Hoskisson, 2018). This is not surprising given the initial emphasis of
upper echelons theory on CEO and group-level TMT characteristics
(Carpenter, Geletkanycz, & Sanders, 2004). Several studies supplement
upper echelons theory with other theories, such as leadership
theories or personality theory. For instance, Makri and
Scandura (2010) found that the interaction between the CEO's

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
creative leadership and operational leadership is positively related to a
firm's innovation quantity. Moreover, Gerstner et al. (2013) showed
that narcissistic CEOs are more willing to adopt discontinuous
technologies.
Agency theory (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) is the second most frequently
used theory (31 articles). In line with agency theory's focus on
the relationship between principles and agents (Eisenhardt, 1989),
several studies shed light on the role of board-level characteristics in
interaction with CEO (e.g., Lim, 2015) or TMT characteristics
(e.g., Kang & Zaheer, 2018; Kor, 2006). For example, Zona (2016) analyzed
the interactive effect of the board's outsider ratio and CEO tenure
on R&D intensity. Other articles focus on relationships between
innovation and certain board characteristics, such as board composition
(e.g., Osma, 2008; Robeson & O'Connor, 2013), or board compensation
and ownership (e.g., Deutsch, 2007; Kang & Zaheer, 2018).
Some studies investigate individual CEO characteristics (e.g., Balkin,
Markman, & Gomez-Mejia, 2000; Zahra, 2005). Consistent with
agency theory's emphasis on the design of appropriate incentive
structures (Eisenhardt, 1989), the majority of these studies analyze
how innovation is related to CEO compensation and ownership
(e.g., Fong, 2010). For example, Makri et al. (2006) found a positive
relationship between citations of firm patents and CEO compensation.
Few studies integrate agency theory with other theories, such as the
resource-based view (Balkin, Markman, & Gomez-Mejia, 2000;
Kor, 2006; Qian, Wang, Geng, & Yu, 2017) or upper echelons theory
(Heyden, Reimer, & van Doorn, 2017; Kor, 2006).
The authors apply other theoretical lenses much less frequently.
These include, for instance, the resource-based view (e.g., Eisenhardt &
Schoonhoven, 1996; Somaya, Williamson, & Zhang, 2007). Building on
the notion that a firm's unique resources create sustainable competitive
advantages (Barney, 1991), a few scholars investigate the impact of
firm resources, such as social capital (Kemper, Schilke, & Brettel, 2013)
and R&D management capabilities (Deeds, DeCarolis, &
Coombs, 2000), on innovation outcomes. Other studies based on leadership
theory investigate the relationship between specific types of
leadership and technological innovation (e.g., Osborn & Marion, 2009).
Scholars occasionally employ other theoretical lenses, such as the
attention-based view (Koryak, Lockett, Hayton, Nicolaou, &
Mole, 2018; Maula, Keil, & Zahra, 2013) or resource-dependence theory
(Datta & Guthrie, 1994; Wu, 2008). Kalyta (2009) combined findings
from managerial hegemony and optimal contracting theory to
deduce compensation transparency theory. The author found that
CEOs with supplemental retirement plans contingent on firm performance
reduce R&D investments as they approach retirement. H. Li
et al. (2007) used procedural justice theory and found that a higher
degree of perceived procedural justice in the TMT's decisions is positively
related to the performance of newly developed products.
G. Chen et al. (2005) drew from the theory of cooperation and competition
(Deutsch, 1973, 2011) and found that cooperative conflict management
among theTMT positively affects theTMT's effectiveness and
innovation outcomes, whereas competitive and conflict-avoiding
approaches have the opposite effect.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Finally, some articles do not explicitly adopt a theoretical lens and
put little emphasis on extant theory. Many of those studies stem
from the fields of finance and economics (e.g., Chen, Podolski,
Rhee, & Veeraraghavan, 2014; Dang & Xu, 2018; Frydman &
Papanikolaou, 2018). The most likely explanation for this observation
is differences in academic conventions across fields.
3.2 | Innovation-related constructs
As mentioned above, we distinguish among innovation input, output,
and processes. In addition, we identify several constructs related to
the intraorganizational context. We first introduce the innovationrelated
constructs before reviewing the relationships between these
constructs and strategic leaders' characteristics.
3.2.1 | Innovation input
Most studies of innovation input focus on R&D measures. Scholars
mainly measure R&D intensity, which is the firm's R&D investments
scaled by a firm-specific factor, such as sales (e.g., Cassell, Huang,
Sanchez, & Stuart, 2012), the book value of assets (e.g., Flammer &
Bansal, 2017; Hirshleifer, Low, & Teoh, 2012), the firm's market value
(e.g., Celikyurt, Sevilir, & Shivdasani, 2014), or the number of
employees (e.g., Baysinger, Kosnik, & Turk, 1991; Deutsch, 2007).
Some authors use absolute R&D investments owing to certain features
of their sample or research setting (e.g., Dalziel, Gentry, &
Bowerman, 2011; Rose, Rose, Norman, & Mazza, 2014) or to complement
their analysis of R&D intensity (e.g., Jung, Chow, & Wu, 2003).
A few authors investigate the external adoption of technologies.
In that regard, most scholars use variables related to research alliances
FIGURE 3 Main theoretical lenses. CEO, chief executive officer; TMT, top management team

14678683, 2020, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/corg.12351 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
that create opportunities for firms to obtain innovation input.
Whereas some scholars analyze the number of formed alliances
(Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1996; Howard, Withers, & Tihanyi, 2017)
or whether companies would hypothetically form or did form an R&D
alliance (Sullivan & Tang, 2013; Tyler & Steensma, 1998), Kang and
Zaheer (2018) examined the network distance between research
alliance partners (i.e., the length of the shortest path between the
partners in an alliance before the actual formation of that alliance).
Other researchers analyze additional aspects of technology adoption.
For example, Gerstner et al. (2013) investigated the number of new
strategic initiatives, ranging from the formation of research
alliances and internal R&D projects to the acquisition of new
technologies.
3.2.2 | Innovation output
With regard to innovation output, researchers primarily consider the
number of patents (e.g., Balsmeier, Buchwald, & Stiebale, 2014;
Mao & Zhang, 2018) and patent citations (e.g., Faleye, Hoitash, &
Hoitash, 2011; Martin, Washburn, Makri, & Gomez-Mejia, 2015).
Most studies that analyze the number of patents use them as a proxy
for innovation quantity or innovation activities (e.g., Jung, Chow, &
Wu, 2003; Makri & Scandura, 2010). Kaplan (2008a), for example,
analyzed the degree to which firms invest in new technological fields
by comparing the number of patents in those fields with the firms'
total number of patents. All studies in our sample that rely on patent
data count the number of granted patents instead of patent applications
owing to data availability, but they use the patent application
date to determine when the innovation activity took place (Wu,
Levitas, & Priem, 2005).
As patent counts do not account for variations in the technological
and economic impacts of different patents (Hall, Jaffe, &
Trajtenberg, 2005), scholars often use patent citations to measure
innovation output. First, scholars use patent citations as a supplementary
proxy for innovation output that accounts for output quality
(e.g., Chen, Podolski, Rhee, & Veeraraghavan, 2014; Sunder, Sunder, &
Zhang, 2017). Second, some scholars conduct more nuanced analyses
of innovation output through patent citations (e.g., Cremers, Litov, &
Sepe, 2017; Faleye, Hoitash, & Hoitash, 2011). For instance, Cho and
Kim (2017) identified patents with the largest number of forward citations
and classify them as breakthrough innovations with high impacts
in specific technological fields.
Other scholars examine the introduction of new products, services,
or processes. Some simply count the number of such introductions
(e.g., Li, Maggitti, Smith, Tesluk, & Katila, 2013; Lyngsie &
Foss, 2017; Nadkarni & Chen, 2014). A few researchers analyze the
point in time at which firms introduce a new offering (Eggers &
Kaplan, 2009; Haneda & Ito, 2018; Srivastava & Lee, 2005).
Others use additional measures based on products, services, and processes
developed by firms, such as the percentage of revenue attributable
to innovation output (Mihalache, Jansen, van den Bosch, &
Volberda, 2012) or the degree of innovativeness in innovation output
(e.g., Cook & Glass, 2015; Talke, Salomo, & Kock, 2011). Notably, few
authors specifically consider processes in their analyses (Haneda &
Ito, 2018; Qian, Cao, & Takeuchi, 2013; Swink, 2000).
3.2.3 | Innovation process
A few scholars analyze the links between innovation input and
output. Some either directly assess the firm's product-development
capabilities (Brentani & Kleinschmidt, 2004; Kleinschmidt,
Brentani, & Salomo, 2007; Swink, 2000) or use measures that
combine aspects of innovation input- and output-related constructs
to evaluate a firm's development capabilities (e.g., Kemper, Schilke, &
Brettel, 2013).
Other scholars analyze innovation efficiency. More specifically,
they measure patent output relative to R&D investments
(e.g., Bannò, 2016; Chemmanur, Kong, Krishnan, & Yu, 2019;
Galasso & Simcoe, 2011) to evaluate the degree to which firms
transform innovation input into output. Still other scholars analyze the
firm's output elasticity, which is defined as changes in revenue
resulting from changes in R&D (Cremers, Litov, & Sepe, 2017).
3.2.4 | Intraorganizational innovation context
Some researchers investigate the underlying intraorganizational innovation
context. We identify two key factors in this regard. First,
researchers study executives' influence on innovation, often using surveys
directed at the CEO (Elenkov, Judge, & Wright, 2005) or the
TMT (Elenkov & Manev, 2005; Hegarty & Hoffmann, 1990;
Hoffman & Hegarty, 1993). Second, scholars frequently analyze firms'
innovation orientation or innovation culture. Most of these
researchers focus on the ambidextrous orientation of firms, or the
degree to which firms emphasize exploratory or exploitative
innovation (e.g., Cao, Simsek, & Zhang, 2010; Ou, Waldman, &
Peterson, 2018; Tuncdogan, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2015). Most
scholars employ survey-based measures to study this organizational
factor (e.g., Chen, Tang, Cooke, & Jin, 2016; Heavey, Simsek, &
Fox, 2015; Kammerlander, Burger, Fust, & Fueglistaller, 2015). A few
also analyze patent citations to distinguish between firms' exploratory
and exploitative innovation efforts (e.g., Balsmeier, Fleming, &
Manso, 2017; Custódio, Ferreira, & Matos, 2019). Finally, some
studies directly measure firms' innovation culture using survey-based
measures (Berson, Oreg, & Dvir, 2008; Zhang, Ou, Tsui, &
Wang, 2017).
3.3 | The relationship between strategic leaders
and technological innovation
Various studies illuminate the innovation-related effects of individualand
group-level characteristics of the board, characteristics of the
CEO, and individual- and group-level characteristics of theTMT.

characteristics
Relatively little research has focused on the impact of individual directors'
characteristics on technological innovation. In fact, we identified
research on only one situation in this regard—when the board's chairperson
is an outside director, a case often referred to as “CEO nonduality”
(e.g., Finkelstein & D'Aveni, 1994; Zona, 2016). The key idea
in these studies is that outside board chairs can align the interests of
management and shareholders to mitigate agency problems, which
are particularly prevalent in the innovation context owing to the
inherent risk and uncertainty. Kor (2006), for example, reported a positive
relationship between CEO nonduality and innovation input,
suggesting that outside chairpersons might be able to encourage management
to focus on long-term investments. Zona (2016) identified
CEO tenure as a moderator of this relationship, finding that CEO nonduality
increases R&D investments in case of long CEO tenure but
reduces them in cases of short CEO tenure. He suggests that board
power can only amplify R&D investments when the CEO has secured
sufficient discretion through longer tenure. Other research finds that
CEO nonduality strengthens the effects of CEO stock ownership
(Lim, 2015) and family ownership (Chen & Hsu, 2009) on innovation
outcomes. Balsam et al. (2016) studied the reverse relationship—how
innovation affects strategic leaders. They find that R&D-intensive
firms are more likely to have an outside board chair, and they argue
that shareholders of such firms might prefer an outside chairperson to
ensure oversight over management. Overall, Balsam et al.'s (2016)
findings suggest that Kor's results should be treated with caution.
3.3.2 | Group-level board characteristics
More research has examined the board's group-level demographic
characteristics in the context of technological innovation. Generally,
this stream of research finds a positive relationship between gender
and racial diversity and innovation outcomes, as such diversity might
contribute novel perspectives and ideas to board discussions (Bernile,
Bhagwat, & Yonker, 2018; Miller & Triana, 2009). Cook and
Glass (2015) found that the positive association between board diversity
and product innovation was particularly important in a sample of
US firms “when a White CEO operates with a diverse board” (p. 117).
With regard to board members' prior experience, research finds
that the innovation outcomes of work-related experience and
education-related experience differ. Work experience in other firms
and industries influences directors' decisions on complex strategic
issues, including technological innovation. In this regard, firms show
higher innovation input and output when they have a higher number
of outside directors with work experience in patent-intensive firms
(Balsmeier, Buchwald, & Stiebale, 2014) or with technical, researchrelated
work experience (Dalziel, Gentry, & Bowerman, 2011;
Haneda & Ito, 2018). Dalziel et al. (2011) showed that directors' entrepreneurial
finance experience is negatively related to R&D
investments—such experience might lead directors to focus on costeffective
research practices. The implications of educational experience
are less clear. Whereas an elite education among directors is positively
linked to innovation input, outside directors with a doctoral-level
education, which should equip them with research-related skills, is
surprisingly negatively related to innovation input (Dalziel, Gentry, &
Bowerman, 2011). The same authors find no link between inside
directors' doctoral degrees or entrepreneurial finance experience and
R&D investments—stressing the need to distinguish between inside
and outside directors.
A considerable body of work studies the effects of board composition
and structure on technological innovation. Most studies investigate
the impact of board independence on innovation outcomes by
analyzing the ratio of outside directors to inside directors. In his metaanalysis,
Y. Deutsch (2005) found a negative relationship between this
ratio and innovation input. Notably, these findings contradict traditional
agency theory, which highlights the importance of outside
directors in reducing managers' reluctance to invest in risky, long-term
innovation activities (David, Hitt, & Gimeno, 2001; Jensen &
Meckling, 1976). One explanation might be that outside directors prefer
external innovation acquisition because they have limited knowledge
of internal R&D processes (Hoskisson, Hitt, Johnson, &
Grossman, 2002). Moreover, Zona (2016) provided evidence that the
negative relationship between the outsider ratio and innovation input
might be contingent on CEO tenure, as he observes positive effects at
later stages of CEO tenure. Relatedly, Osma (2008) showed that a
higher number of outside directors can lower the tendency of CEOs
to reduce R&D investments when their firms face reduced earnings or
losses. With regard to innovation output, research finds a positive
relationship between the outsider ratio and both an organization's
overall patenting activities and exploitative innovation, indicating that
intensified monitoring by outside directors might push managers to
focus on less risky, more quantifiable innovation output (Balsmeier,
Fleming, & Manso, 2017). Partly supporting this argument, Arzubiaga
et al. (2018) showed that the board's engagement in monitoring and
advising amplifies the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation
and ambidextrous innovation in a sample of Spanish family firms.
Additional findings on the impact of directors' family membership
on innovation outcomes highlight the importance of the firm and
corporate-governance contexts. On the one hand, Matzler
et al. (2015) found that family presence on the supervisory boards of
German firms decreases innovation input and strengthens innovation
output, suggesting higher innovation efficiency. On the other hand,
Bannò (2016) identified a negative relationship between the share of
family representatives on the boards of Italian family firms and innovation
efficiency.
Board incentives have been studied only as they relate to stock
ownership. First, studies indicate that board incentives can help
increase the board's monitoring activities and, thereby, counter CEOs'
risk aversion.1 In particular, higher proportions of stock ownership by
outside directors seem to curb the tendency of CEOs with more stock
ownership to reduce R&D investments (Lim, 2015). Moreover, higher
values of outside directors' stock options intensify the tendency of
firms to increase R&D investments if they experience a decline in

returns on assets (Lim & McCann, 2014). Second, research suggests
that outside directors' limited knowledge of internal innovation processes
and capabilities affects their decision making. Hoskisson
et al. (2002) showed that outside directors' stock ownership is positively
associated with the acquisition of external innovations, whereas
inside directors' stock ownership is positively related to internal innovation.
Along the same lines, Kang and Zaheer (2018) found that outside
directors' stock ownership is positively associated with firms
choosing partners for R&D alliances that have no prior ties to the
focal firm.
Finally, scholars have studied the implications of boards' networks
and social ties, and they found that such social capital typically makes
it easier for organizations to acquire necessary resources. First, board
interlock ties facilitate the formation of R&D alliances between the
interlocked firms (Howard, Withers, & Tihanyi, 2017; Sullivan &
Tang, 2013). Second, ties to other firms provide boards with information
relevant for their tasks. Although a greater number of ties to
high-technology firms enable directors to ensure the cost-efficient
usage of R&D funds, stronger ties to low-technology firms have the
opposite effect (Dalziel, Gentry, & Bowerman, 2011). M. Li (2019)
showed that both industry diversity in board ties and board interlocks
with R&D-intensive firms increase the likelihood that firms engage in
technological exploration. However, M. Li also found that the ratio of
interlocks among directors with output functional experience is negatively
associated with technological exploration, suggesting that interlocks
among directors with this experience might be less important
for technological innovation. Third, some ties hinder innovation. As
Rose et al. (2014) showed, this seems to be the case for directors'
intraorganizational friendship ties with the CEO, which are positively
related to reductions in innovation investments aimed at providing
short-term benefits to the CEO. Noticeably, this effect increases with
the disclosure of such ties (Rose, Rose, Norman, & Mazza, 2014),
highlighting the reputational effects of social relationships in firm
governance.
3.3.3 | Individual-level CEO characteristics
A large body of research analyzes CEO characteristics in the context
of innovation. Several studies investigate demographic characteristics
as proxies for CEOs' cognitive frames (Hambrick, 2007). In this regard,
various scholars find detrimental effects of age and tenure on CEOs'
risk appetite, ability to process new information and, consequently,
innovation activities. The longer a CEO is in office, the less that CEO
is willing to invest in technological innovation—CEOs with longer tenures
are more committed to established paradigms, and they tend to
emphasize stability over technological change (Barker &
Mueller, 2002; Zahra, 2005). Cheng (2004) demonstrated that compensation
committees aim to alleviate this career-horizon problem by
more closely linking R&D spending to compensation for older CEOs.
Moreover, high CEO age and a limited career horizon are associated
with both reduced innovation input and output, as older CEOs might
be less inclined to embrace new ideas and organizational changes
(Barker & Mueller, 2002; Heyden, Reimer, & van Doorn, 2017;
Kalyta, 2009). These findings also suggest that the reduced investments
in R&D by older and longer tenured CEOs are not an indicator
of greater innovation efficiency but rather a reflection of the preference
of those CEOs to engage in short-term investments. In support
of this argument, Cho and Kim (2017) found that the reduction in
R&D investments mediates the negative relationship between CEO
tenure and innovation output.
Work and educational experience are also related to CEOs' decision
making regarding innovation (Barker & Mueller, 2002). Work
experience in output functions that are characterized by an emphasis
on business growth through the development of new products or new
markets seems to lead CEOs to favor innovation strategies and is,
consequently, associated with increased R&D spending. With regard
to educational experience, there is a positive relationship between the
CEO's number of science or engineering degrees and R&D expenditure,
whereas the overall education level and number of business
degrees have no significant effects as long as the CEO holds a college
degree. However, this relationship might be driven by reverse causality,
as Datta and Guthrie (1994) found that R&D-intensive firms are
more likely to select CEOs with technical experience and a higher
level of education.
Moreover, studies indicate a significant impact of CEO personality
on innovation outcomes. Interestingly, although not surprising given
the potentially glamorous but risky nature of technological innovation,
firms' technological innovation outcomes seem to be a function of
CEO personality traits related to risk seeking, a sense of superiority,
and a desire for attention or acclaim, that is, sensation-seeking
(Sunder, Sunder, & Zhang, 2017), overconfidence (Galasso &
Simcoe, 2011; Hirshleifer, Low, & Teoh, 2012), hubris (Tang,
Li, & Yang, 2015), and narcissism (Gerstner, König,
Enders, & Hambrick, 2013), the latter also in paradoxical combination
with humility (Zhang, Ou, Tsui, & Wang, 2017). Apparently, innovation
requires narcissistic tendencies, which allow a CEO to derive utility
from attention and to be less hesitant to invest despite unfavorable
odds and substantial resource rigidity in organizations (Gerstner,
König, Enders, & Hambrick, 2013; Gilbert, 2005). Furthermore,
H. Zhang et al. (2017) found that CEOs' socialized charisma (i.e., their
ability to inspire employees and to ensure support for novel routines
and practices) mediates the positive interaction effect of high degrees
of humility and narcissism on firms' innovation orientation.
Scholars have also examined the cognitive processes through
which CEOs attend to and perceive their environment. First, studies
show that CEO attention to specific technologies or productdevelopment
processes affects related innovation outcomes
(Calantone, Vickery, & Dröge, 1995; Eggers & Kaplan, 2009). For
example, Kaplan (2008a) showed how changes in CEOs' attention to
fiber-optic technologies were associated with more patenting activities
in this field. Relatedly, CEOs' temporal orientations matter. In
dynamic environments, firms are more likely to introduce new products
when the CEO is focused on the present and the future. In stable
environments, firms are more likely to do so when the CEO is more
focused on the past and the present (Nadkarni & Chen, 2014). In an

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
examination of personality traits, attention, and innovation outcomes,
Gerstner et al. (2013) found that top management's attention to discontinuous
innovation is shaped by the CEO's personal preferences.
In particular, that level of attention increases with CEO narcissism. In
turn, managerial attention mediates the effect of CEO narcissism on
discontinuous technology adoption, at least during the technology's
era of ferment.
Second, CEOs' perceptions of environmental and firm characteristics
are related to technological innovation. Kammerlander
et al. (2015) observed a positive effect of CEOs' promotion focus on
firms' exploration and exploitation activities, as CEOs with high levels
of promotion focus aim to maximize their achievements and their
firms' competitive position by engaging in long-term exploratory activities
and shorter term exploitative activities. Conversely, they show
that CEOs' prevention focus—characterized by a desire to avoid
failure—is negatively (albeit only marginally significantly) linked to
exploration. Martin et al. (2015) found that CEOs' perceptions of firm
efficacy moderate the relationship between CEO incentives and innovation
output. There is a positive relationship at high levels of perceived
firm efficacy because CEOs might pursue innovation to
increase their personal wealth. The opposite is true for low levels of
perceived efficacy. With respect to perceived environmental characteristics,
Lefebvre et al. (1997) showed that perceived environmental
dynamism increases the positive effects of a firm's technology policy
(i.e., the degree to which a firm pursues technological changes and
recruits relevant human resources) on innovation outcomes, whereas
higher perceived hostility has negative effects on such policies, likely
because it reduces investments with long payoff horizons.
The CEO's leadership style also influences technological innovation
outcomes. The most studied leadership style in this context is
transformational leadership, which positively affects innovation outcomes
(Elenkov & Manev, 2005; Jung, Chow, & Wu, 2003; Jung,
Wu, & Chow, 2008). This is not surprising given that the key elements
of transformational leadership—charisma, idealized influence, and
intellectual stimulation—enable leaders to elicit commitment from
subordinates and drive employees' creativity (Jung, Wu, &
Chow, 2008; Oldham & Cummings, 1996). Various organizational and
environmental characteristics strengthen the relationship between
transformational leadership and innovation outcomes, including an
organizational climate of support for innovation, lower centralization
and formalization within the organization, and higher degrees of competition
and environmental uncertainty (Jung, Wu, & Chow, 2008).
Y. Chen et al. (2014) highlighted the role of corporate entrepreneurship
(i.e., a firm's venturing and renewal activities) as a mechanism
through which transformational CEOs improve innovation practices.
They argue that transformational CEOs encourage employees to
reconsider established routines and foster new business venturing,
which improves the odds of corporate entrepreneurship in the organization.
They consequently find that corporate entrepreneurship mediates
the relationship between transformational leadership and
product innovation.
Other research explores the differences between transformational
and transactional leadership, where the latter is characterized
by a focus on clearly defined goal/reward systems for subordinates
(Jansen, Vera, & Crossan, 2009). Elenkov and Manev (2005) identified
generally positive effects of both leadership styles on organizational
innovation. Jansen et al. (2009) found that transformational leadership
positively affects exploratory innovation, whereas transactional leadership
reduces flexibility and creativity and, thus, engenders exploitative
innovation.
Research concerning other aspects of the relationship between
CEO leadership styles and innovation is more limited. Elenkov and
Manev (2005) found that laissez-faire leadership is negatively associated
with organizational innovation, whereas they find no effects of
active or passive management by exception. Makri and Scandura
(2010) showed a significant positive interactive effect of creative
and operational leadership on innovation quantity in high-tech firms,
and they demonstrate that the highest levels of innovation quantity
are achieved when both leadership dimensions are high. They find no
effect on innovation quality and that only creative leadership (not
operational leadership) is positively related to the use of science in
innovation.
Various studies analyze the relationship between CEO incentives
and innovation outcomes. Many of these studies focus on CEO compensation
and argue that firms reward CEOs for risky, long-term
investments in innovation. For example, studies find that innovation
outcomes are positively associated with total CEO compensation
(Makri, Lane, & Gomez-Mejia, 2006) and long-term option compensation
(Baranchuk, Kieschnick, & Moussawi, 2014; Cheng, 2004). Other
studies account for specific requirements in research-intensive industries
and find a positive link between innovation input and output and
short-term CEO compensation (Balkin, Markman, &
Gomez-Mejia, 2000). In exploring the reverse relationship, Fong (2010)
found that relatively underpaid CEOs in R&D-intensive industries are
associated with higher R&D spending, whereas lower innovation input
is evident when CEOs are underpaid in less R&D-intensive industries.
The underlying argument is that CEO compensation and R&D investments
are better aligned in R&D-intensive industries. Research investigating
broader cross-industry samples suggests nuanced effects of
different compensation components on innovation outcomes.
Whereas compensation-based risk incentives are positively associated
with innovation output (Mao & Zhang, 2018), large CEO inside debt
holdings (Cassell, Huang, Sanchez, & Stuart, 2012) and deferred compensation
and pension benefits (Kalyta, 2009) can reduce risk-seeking
behavior and, in turn, diminish innovation input.
Several scholars analyze CEO stock ownership or stock options. On
the one hand, there is a positive relationship between CEOs' general
firm ownership and innovation outcomes (Barker & Mueller, 2002;
Gedajlovic, Cao, & Zhang, 2012). On the other hand, higher values of
stocks and options to be exercised in the short term (Edmans, Fang, &
Lewellen, 2017) and increasing values of restricted stock (Lim, 2015)
are negatively associated with R&D intensity. Some scholars include
additional characteristics of the focal firm or its strategic leaders in
their analyses. For example, Lim (2015) found that increased board
vigilance due to a higher proportion of outside directors with more
stock options can alleviate the negative relationship between higher

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
restricted stock values of CEOs and their firms' R&D investments.
Similarly, Zona (2016) demonstrated that incentivizing CEOs through
stock options can mitigate the detrimental effects of CEOs' career
horizons on innovation outcomes. Gedajlovic et al. (2012) attempted
to identify the causal mechanisms linking CEO ownership with innovation
outcomes by exploring the mediating effect of the degree to
which the TMT engages in comprehensive decision making. The
authors argue that CEO shareholdings, as a proxy for management
shareholdings, incentivize managers to engage in comprehensive
decision-making procedures. In their study of a sample of Chinese
high-tech small- and medium-sized enterprises, they find that the
TMT's decision comprehensiveness partially mediates the positive
relationship between CEO stock ownership and ambidextrous
innovation.
Finally, research points to both positive and mimetic effects of
CEOs' network ties and social capital in the innovation context. The
size of a CEO's network facilitates access to relevant information and
can positively affect the firm's innovation outcomes (Cao, Simsek, &
Zhang, 2010; Faleye, Kovacs, & Venkateswaran, 2014). In addition,
CEOs' outside directorships foster strategic imitation and result in
similar R&D intensity in the CEOs' home firms—an effect that
increases with the tenure of CEOs as outside directors (Oh &
Barker, 2018).
3.3.4 | Individual-level TMT member
characteristics
Few researchers examine the individual characteristics of top executives
other than the CEO. Scholars find that firms' innovation activities
can have a positive impact on the appointment of chief diversity officers
(Shi, Pathak, Song, & Hoskisson, 2018) and the compensation of
chief marketing officers (Bansal, Joseph, Ma, & Wintoki, 2017). Garms
and Engelen (2019) highlighted a positive link between chief technology
officers' (CTOs') level of structural power, which is derived from
their hierarchical position in the TMT and affects their influence on
the TMT's decision making, and innovation outcomes. The same
authors demonstrate that CTOs' expert power, which originates from
their technical expertise, is negatively related to innovation outcomes,
and they suggest that CTOs high in expert power might be more
aware of innovation-inherent risks.
3.3.5 | Group-level TMT characteristics
More research examines theTMT as a group in the context of technological
innovation. Some of these studies investigate the TMTs' demographic
characteristics. Although Bantel and Jackson (1989) did not
find a significant direct effect of TMT age on innovation adoption,
higher mean TMT age can aggravate the negative effect of a CEO's
short career horizon on R&D intensity (Heyden, Reimer, & van
Doorn, 2017). Relatedly, and similar to the findings regarding CEO
tenure, a negative link exists between longer TMT tenure and R&D
intensity (Kor, 2006). On the other hand, the benefits of knowledge
derived from a longer tenure might outweigh inertial effects in hightech
industries. For instance, Srivastava and Lee (2005) found that
longer TMT tenure results in slower new product introductions and a
lower likelihood of becoming an industry's first mover in product
introductions in the telecom and brewing industries, whereas the
opposite is true in the computer industry. J. Chen et al. (2019) also
measured TMT tenure diversity and find a positive relationship
betweenTMT tenure diversity and organizational ambidexterity.
Moreover, TMT education affects innovation outcomes. Science
or engineering degrees (Scherer & Huh, 1992) as well as a higher level
of education in the TMT (Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Heyden, Reimer, &
van Doorn, 2017) can foster innovation. In contrast, Deeds
et al. (2000) found a marginally significant negative relationship
between the share of TMT members with doctoral degrees and the
number of new products developed, which hints at potentially detrimental
effects when technical talents move from the laboratory to
management positions. Furthermore, Heyden et al. (2017) found that
a higher educational level in the TMT does not alleviate CEO horizon
problems.
With regard to the prior work experience of TMT members, when
theTMT is experienced in specific topics or industries, it generally has
a stronger focus on innovation activities related to those topics or
industries (e.g., Hoffman & Hegarty, 1993; Somaya, Williamson, &
Zhang, 2007; Urbig, Bürger, Patzelt, & Schweizer, 2013). For example,
Tyler and Steensma (1998) found a positive relationship between the
technical work experience of TMT members and their assessments of
potential research alliances. Kor (2006) found a positive relationship
between shared experiences among TMT members and technological
innovation. In addition, heterogeneity in TMT members' functional
backgrounds moderates the relationship between the board's outsider
ratio and the firm's R&D intensity—for higher levels of TMT functional
heterogeneity, the board's outsider ratio is increasingly negatively
related to R&D intensity, whereas there is an increasingly positive
relationship for lower levels of heterogeneity (Kor, 2006).
Other research specifically analyzes diversity in the TMT's demographic
characteristics, such as the share of females (Dezsö &
Ross, 2012); nationality diversity (Boone, Lokshin, Guenter, &
Belderbos, 2019); and heterogeneity in educational, functional, industry,
and organizational backgrounds (Talke, Salomo, & Kock, 2011).
This research generally finds positive links between such types of
diversity and innovation outcomes. However, Lyngsie and Foss (2017)
cautioned that the positive association between a higher share of
female top managers and innovation outcomes only occurs above a
certain threshold, whereas the initial addition of femaleTMT members
is even negatively associated with innovation outcomes.
Studies investigating TMT composition and structure mainly focus
on the impact of TMT size on decision-making speed and processes
(West & Anderson, 1996). A larger TMT is positively linked to alliance
formation, as it is more likely to have the required resources, such as
connections to potential partners (Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1996).
In addition, firms with larger TMTs are more likely to be the first to
introduce new products in an industry (Srivastava & Lee, 2005).

Some studies examineTMT composition and structure in the context
of family firms. Matzler et al. (2015) showed that the number of
family members in the TMT can positively affect innovation input and
output. Notably, Vandekerkhof et al. (2015) demonstrated that a
higher degree of firm innovation increases the need for the expertise
of nonfamily TMT members. However, for firms with high levels of
socioemotional wealth and thus a focus on family-related objectives,
they find that the degree of innovation has no impact on the appointment
of nonfamily TMT members. Moreover, Kraiczy et al. (2015)
found a positive moderating effect of TMT family members' closeness
to the first or founding generation on the relationship between the
CEO's risk-taking propensity and product innovation.
Beyond demographic variables and TMT composition, research is
increasingly focused on collaboration and behavior within the TMT in
the context of technological innovation. This literature highlights the
importance of cooperation within the TMT for managing complex
innovation processes (Chen, Tjosvold, & Liu, 2006). In that regard,
behavioral integration (Halevi, Carmeli, & Brueller, 2015; Lubatkin,
Simsek, Ling, & Veiga, 2006), a shared vision and social integration
(Jansen, George, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2008), and general TMT
integration (Ou, Waldman, & Peterson, 2018) can be beneficial for
innovation outcomes, especially in the context of ambidextrous innovation
that requires the balancing of partly contradictory exploitative
innovation and explorative innovation. For instance, Ou et al. (2018)
found that TMT integration (i.e., collaboration, information sharing,
and joint decision making within the TMT) partially mediates the
impact of CEO–TMT pay disparity in that pay disparity negatively
relates to TMT integration, but TMT integration positively relates to
ambidextrous innovation. Finally, collaborative behavior is important
in the context of conflict management in the TMT (e.g., Qian, Cao, &
Takeuchi, 2013). For example, G. Chen et al. (2005) found that cooperative
conflict management in the TMT improves team effectiveness
and, thereby, innovation outcomes.
Several authors explore the ways in which the TMT works and
the activities on which it focuses (e.g., Alexiev, Jansen, Bosch, &
Volberda, 2010; Li, Bingham, & Umphress, 2007). For example,
Heavey and Simsek (2017) found that the TMT's transactive
memory—its ability to efficiently generate, distribute, and integrate
knowledge based on individual managers' expertise—is positively
related to organizational ambidexterity. As another example, Q. Li
et al. (2013) found a positive relationship between the degree to
which TMT members conduct innovation searches in unfamiliar and
distant terrains and new product introductions, whereas the extent to
which TMTs engage in effortful search is negatively related to this
innovation outcome.
Furthermore, in line with the findings for board and CEO incentives,
TMT compensation can compel managers to incorporate longterm
considerations, like innovation, into their decision making. In that
regard, higher total annual TMT compensation is positively related to
firms' R&D intensity (Zhang, Chen, & Feng, 2014). In addition, the
value of TMTs' exercisable stock options is positively related to firms'
R&D spending, as managers might anticipate a positive reaction of
investors to increased R&D investments (Souder & Bromiley, 2017).
In contrast, short-term performance incentives are negatively associated
with R&D intensity (Hoskisson, Hitt, & Hill, 1993). However,
studies investigating the reverse relationship highlight the importance
of considering potential endogeneity, as higher R&D intensity is
related to an increased duration of executive compensation, that is, a
longer average vesting period of the TMT's compensation components
(Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, & Thakor, 2014), and higher values of firm
patents are associated with higher average TMT compensation
(Frydman & Papanikolaou, 2018).
Finally, some research investigates whether TMT network ties
provide executives with valuable information and resources in the
innovation context. This research suggests, similar to that on CEO
social capital, that substantial managerial ties are beneficial for innovation
outcomes (Heavey, Simsek, & Fox, 2015; Kemper, Schilke, &
Brettel, 2013). In a meta-analysis, Kraft and Bausch (2018) found that
cohesive managerial networks (i.e., small networks with strong ties)
are more beneficial for innovation in environments with weak political,
regulatory, and financial institutions, whereas diverse networks
stimulate innovation in more stable environments.
3.4 | Major contextual moderating factors
The literature review shows that the relationship between strategic
leadership and technological innovation also depends on contextual
factors. In this regard, we distinguish between environmental and
organizational factors (Damanpour & Aravind, 2006).
3.4.1 | Environmental factors
Most studies considering contextual factors analyze environmental
factors beyond the organization's boundaries. Some scholars analyze
the sociocultural context—with mixed results. Those studies that consider
the moderating impact of the firm location do not find a significant
influence on the relationships between the TMT's functional role
(Hegarty & Hoffmann, 1990), the TMT's experience (Hoffman &
Hegarty, 1993), or its leadership behavior (Elenkov, Judge, &
Wright, 2005) and innovation outcomes. In contrast, Hofstede's cultural
dimensions do moderate the impact of TMT leadership style on
innovation (Elenkov & Manev, 2005). Relatedly, Boone et al. (2019)
uncovered several partially moderating effects of Hofstede's national
power distance on the relationship between the TMT's national diversity
and innovation outcomes.
With regard to environmental dynamism, scholars provide stronger,
albeit partially inconclusive, evidence of moderating effects. Multiple
studies find that environmental dynamism and ambiguity
positively moderate the relationship between strategic leaders' characteristics
and innovation (Halevi, Carmeli, & Brueller, 2015; Li, Bingham,
& Umphress, 2007), which hints at an elevated role of strategic
leaders in uncertain environments. Other studies come to the opposite
conclusion, although these findings are only marginally significant
(Carson, Wu, & Moore, 2012; Kemper, Schilke, & Brettel, 2013).

Moreover, in dynamic environments, shorter CEO tenure
(Wu, Levitas, & Priem, 2005) and higher CEO focus on the present
and the future (Nadkarni & Chen, 2014) are beneficial for innovation
outcomes.
A small number of studies investigate the moderating effects of
other environmental factors. Some research considers industry-level
characteristics, such as R&D intensity (Fong, 2010) or secrecy regarding
innovation activities (Erkens, 2011). For instance, Erkens (2011)
found a positive relationship between firms' R&D intensity and TMTs'
unvested stock holdings. This relationship is more pronounced in
industries with a lower propensity to use patents to protect innovation.
Other studies find that competition positively affects the relationship
between strategic leadership and innovation outcomes (Jung, Wu, &
Chow, 2008; Kammerlander, Burger, Fust, & Fueglistaller, 2015).
3.4.2 | Organizational factors
Organizational characteristics also influence the relationship between
strategic leaders and technological innovation. In that regard, the
CEO's focus on technologies might compensate for a lack of organizational
experience with such technologies (Kaplan, 2008a). Furthermore,
firm experience with technological alliances seems to
accentuate top executives' willingness to engage in such alliances
(Tyler & Steensma, 1998). With respect to organizational gender proportions,
Lyngsie and Foss (2017) found that the share of females in
the workforce negatively moderates the relationship between the
share of femaleTMT members and innovation outcomes. With regard
to organizational culture, Jung et al. (2008) found that an organizational
climate of empowerment and support for innovation positively
affect the relationship between CEO transformational leadership and
innovation, whereas centralization and formalization have the opposite
effect. Other scholars find a positive interaction effect between
firms' entrepreneurial orientation and various board characteristics on
firms' innovation orientation (Arzubiaga, Kotlar, De Massis, Maseda, &
Iturralde, 2018) as well as a mediating effect of entrepreneurial
orientation between TMTs' transformational leadership style and
firms' innovation orientation (Kraft & Bausch, 2016).
3.5 | The impact of technological innovation on
performance
Some studies investigate not only the impact of strategic leadership
characteristics on technological innovation but also downstream
performance effects. We distinguish between innovation- and
firm-related performance measures.
3.5.1 | Innovation-related performance measures
Several studies investigate the financial performance of innovations
using such measures as contributions to profitability, market share, or
sales (e.g., Carson, Wu, & Moore, 2012; Li, Bingham, &
Umphress, 2007; Wu, 2008). For example, Cummings and
Knott (2018) found that outside CEO succession is negatively related
to the firm's ability to generate sales through increased R&D investments,
indicating a need for technical expertise and knowledge of
internal processes to ensure the successful management of R&D
investments. A single study investigates the capital market's reaction
to failures in new product development and finds that managerial
experience reduces negative market reactions to such failures (Urbig,
Bürger, Patzelt, & Schweizer, 2013).
3.5.2 | Firm-related performance measures
Other scholars investigate whether the relationship between strategic
leaders and innovation extends to overall firm performance. Several
studies find that the positive effects of strategic leaders' characteristics
on technological innovation lead to increased firm profitability
(e.g., Calantone, Vickery, & Dröge, 1995; Lefebvre, Mason, &
Lefebvre, 1997; Miller & Triana, 2009). Others find a positive impact
of increased innovation efforts on the firm's market value
(e.g., Ammann, Horsch, & Oesch, 2016; Bernile, Bhagwat, &
Yonker, 2018; Talke, Salomo, & Rost, 2010).
4 | AN AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Our review highlights numerous avenues for future research, especially
with regard to new theoretical lenses on strategic leadership and
technological innovation, the role of the board in technological innovation,
and the consequences of technological innovation for strategic
leaders. Other areas of interest relate to research settings and the
measurement of technological innovation, methodological issues, and
the implications of current trends in innovation research.
4.1 | Theoretical lenses
An important research opportunity lies in expanding the theoretical
perspectives beyond the conceptions of upper echelons and agency
theories. As a guide in this direction, scholars could use Georgakakis
et al.'s (2019) review on the interaction between the CEO and the
TMT, which attempts to integrate upper echelons research with role
theory (Biddle, 1986). Scholars could build on Georgakakis et al. to
analyze how interactions between the CEO and individual functional
executives involved in the innovation process affect innovation outcomes.
Moreover, scholars could build on research that criticizes that
agency theory might not sufficiently account for the socially situated
context in which strategic leaders interact (Westphal & Zajac, 2013).
Along those lines, Luciano et al. (2020) recently proposed a novel perspective
on interactions between theTMT and the board—the “strategic
leadership system”—which highlights the common goals of the
TMT and the board while acknowledging their specific responsibilities.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
We see great promise in research that adopts a system view of strategic
leadership and investigates how the exchange and utilization of
experiences and knowledge within and between the board and the
TMT contribute to technological innovation.
Some studies already use further well-established theories, such
as the resource-based view (e.g., Kemper, Schilke, & Brettel, 2013;
Kleinschmidt, Brentani, & Salomo, 2007) or leadership theory
(Elenkov, Judge, & Wright, 2005; Osborn & Marion, 2009), to study
the link between strategic leadership and innovation. However,
scholars could fruitfully draw from a wider variety of alternative theoretical
perspectives that have thus far only been sparsely applied. As
technological innovation requires shifts in organizational routines and
cognitive schemas (König, Graf-Vlachy, & Schöberl, 2020; Tripsas &
Gavetti, 2000), it creates potential for conflict within the group of
strategic leaders (Kammerlander, König, & Richards, 2018). Therefore,
scholars could build on the theory of cooperation and competition
(Deutsch, 1973) to study the role of conflicts and conflict management
among TMT and board members in the context of technological
innovation (Chen, Liu, & Tjosvold, 2005). Compensation transparency
theory (Kalyta, 2009) could improve our understanding of the effects
of transparency in managerial and board compensation on innovation
outcomes. Theories of power (e.g., Sturm & Antonakis, 2015) and paradox
(Smith & Lewis, 2011) could help shed light on the intersection of
strategic leaders' compensation, behaviors, and personalities with
ambidextrous innovation (Ou, Waldman, & Peterson, 2018). Procedural
justice theory, as used by H. Li et al. (2007), could improve our
understanding of interactions between strategic leaders and other
organizational members in the context of technological innovation. As
suggested by Jansen et al. (2016), scholars could also consider building
on social identity theory (Turner & Tajfel, 1986). Higher degrees of
organizational identification among executives may exacerbate inertia,
but it might also make executives more motivated to commit to
long-term goals and, in turn, engage in organizational innovation
activities.
Finally, several relevant theoretical lenses have not yet been used
to examine the relationship between strategic leadership and technological
innovation. First, this field of study has yet to fully make the
“linguistic turn” (Vaara, 2010) that other streams in management studies
have made—in other words, a shift towards viewing leadership as
emerging through the management of the meaning of organizational
events (Clifton, 2012; Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991) and, in turn, towards
the analysis of texts and discursive practices. For example, scholars
could investigate how the rhetoric of strategic leaders contributes to
sensemaking in organizations (Maitlis & Christianson, 2014) that face
technological discontinuities, how strategic leaders legitimize the
related organizational changes (Vaara & Tienari, 2008), and how strategic
leaders are able to “construct” organizational adaptations to
technological change in a positive way (Kaplan, 2008b). Alternatively,
discursive approaches could be combined with findings from
impression-management research (e.g., Davidson, Jiraporn, Kim, &
Nemec, 2004; Graffin, Carpenter, & Boivie, 2011) to study how
strategic leaders attempt to satisfy the expectations of internal and
external audiences in times of technological change.
Second, scholars could build on new institutionalism
(Selznick, 1996) when analyzing strategic leaders in the context of
technological innovation. Technological development is an important
topic in new institutionalism because the exploitation of novel technologies
might require new institutions and established institutions
might become salient owing to technological change (Ingram &
Silverman, n.d.; Weber, Lehmann, Graf-Vlachy, & König, 2019). Building
on institutional theory, scholars could examine the ways in which
institutional governance aspects of incumbent organizations, such as
hierarchies, rules, procedures, and internal politics, affect strategic
leaders' perceptions of uncertainty, their decision making, and their
actions in times of discontinuous change. In this context, scholars
could also study the antecedents of isomorphism and investigate the
characteristics of strategic leaders that inhibit or foster imitation in
firms facing technological change (Krause, Wu, Bruton, &
Carter, 2019).
4.2 | The role of the board of directors in
technological innovation
We identify considerable gaps in our knowledge of the board's role in
innovation, which are particularly important given that research recognizes
the general impact of boards on firm strategy (Carpenter,
Geletkanycz, & Sanders, 2004; Pugliese et al., 2009). Moreover, it is
impossible for scholars to generalize findings from extant research on
the relationship between the CEO and/or the TMT, and technological
innovation to boards, as boards' roles, responsibilities, and agency
differ systematically from those of CEOs and other executives
(Finkelstein, Hambrick, & Cannella, 2009).
Therefore, we encourage scholars to include boundary conditions
of board activities in their research models. As discussed above, most
studies on boards in the context of innovation use easily observable
characteristics of board composition as proxies for board power,
which drives boards' monitoring intensity (Kor, 2006). However,
the quality of board monitoring depends on a host of individual-,
group-, and firm-level characteristics (Boivie, Bednar, Aguilera, &
Andrus, 2016). Treatment of these characteristics as boundary conditions
could substantially improve our understanding of strategic leadership
and innovation. In addition, scholars may consider constructing
alternative measures to capture other relevant properties of the
board. For instance, scholars could use surveys to measure boards'
strategic involvement and activities (Arzubiaga, Kotlar, De Massis,
Maseda, & Iturralde, 2018). Moreover, the effects of board reputation,
status, and prestige (Acharya & Pollock, 2020; Oehmichen, Braun,
Wolff, & Yoshikawa, 2017) could be an interesting area of research.
We also see a need for a better understanding of the effects of
inside and outside directors' education and experience on innovation
outcomes (Dalziel, Gentry, & Bowerman, 2011). Research in this regard
is limited, and the findings are equivocal. Particularly, it is possible that
a higher number of board appointments can severely diminish the beneficial
effects of education and experience owing to excessive
information-processing demands (Khanna, Jones, & Boivie, 2014).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Therefore, including measures of the board's information-processing
demands might shed some light on the innovation-related effects of
the board's educational and work experience.
With respect to individual-level board member characteristics,
research has thus far only considered CEO nonduality (e.g., He &
Wang, 2009; Qian, Wang, Geng, & Yu, 2017), although many other
characteristics of outside board chairpersons or other directors
might influence innovation. For example, Hambrick et al. (2015)
argued that boards with individual directors endowed with sufficient
independence, expertise, and motivation as well as the ability
to devote time and attention to their tasks might be more successful
in preventing governance failures than boards in which these
qualities are distributed among directors. As a starting point,
scholars could study the impact of individual directors' breadth and
depth of work and educational experience (Lungeanu &
Zajac, 2019) on innovation outcomes.
Finally, we suggest that researchers address the innovationrelated
impacts of board subgroups. Only a fraction of the reviewed
studies investigate subgroups defined by age, gender, ethnicity, or
education (Bernile, Bhagwat, & Yonker, 2018; Cook & Glass, 2015;
Dalziel, Gentry, & Bowerman, 2011; Miller & Triana, 2009). However,
such subgroups might affect pivotal aspects of innovation. For example,
subgroup memberships might have different implications for
innovation input and output. Moreover, rather than investigating only
direct effects on innovation outcomes, scholars could study how
directors' affiliations with specific subgroups affect their behavior and,
in turn, innovation outcomes. Clearly, such endeavors would require
scholars to develop novel measures and constructs as well as a
better understanding of collaboration among board members. In
particular, we urge scholars to consider the faultlines literature (Li &
Hambrick, 2005), as faultlines between board subgroups might inhibit
communication, cohesion, and trust and, thereby, affect innovation
decisions (Kaczmarek, Kimino, & Pye, 2012; Tuggle, Schnatterly, &
Johnson, 2010).
4.3 | Consequences of technological innovation
for strategic leaders
Innovation outcomes might substantially influence strategic leadership,
for instance, firms' selection of executives (e.g., Shi, Pathak,
Song, & Hoskisson, 2018), CEO nonduality (Balsam, Puthenpurackal, &
Upadhyay, 2016), and executive compensation (e.g., Erkens, 2011). In
this vein, we see two key avenues for future research on the consequences
of firm innovation for strategic leadership. First, additional
research could study the innovation-related antecedents of board and
TMT composition. For example, scholars could study how and why
CEO nonduality and the board's outsider ratio are a function of innovation.
In this regard, Y. Deutsch (2005) suggested that the negative
impact of the board's outsider ratio on R&D investments might be
explained by reverse causality (i.e., by the desire for appropriate board
vigilance if the CEO shuns R&D investments). Overall, we suggest that
research on the innovation-related determinants of board and TMT
composition should also consider the environmental and organizational
factors from our framework as well as CEO characteristics
(Balsam, Puthenpurackal, & Upadhyay, 2016; Zona, 2016) as potential
moderators.
Second, scholars should study the effects of firm innovativeness
on the cognitive processes and behaviors of strategic leaders. For
example, scholars could study whether firm innovation affects strategic
leaders' attention to and perceptions of certain issues
(Ocasio, 1997) or could investigate the influence of innovation on the
ways in which strategic leaders engage with each other or their
employees. In answering such questions, scholars can build on
research on managerial and board cognition (Kaplan, 2011;
Rindova, 1999) and move beyond studies that merely compare the
relationship between strategic leaders' characteristics and innovation
in high-tech and low-tech industries (e.g., Srivastava & Lee, 2005).
4.4 | Research settings
Scholars might also use novel research settings to uncover new facets
of the relationship between strategic leaders and innovation. Most of
the studies reviewed here focus on US firms—few consider samples
from other countries (e.g., Barney, Foss, & Lyngsie, 2018;
Osma, 2008; Wu, 2008) or multinational samples (e.g., Cheng, 2004;
Eggers & Kaplan, 2009; Elenkov, Judge, & Wright, 2005). However,
cross-contextual differences (e.g., in cultural and legal aspects) are
likely to affect the relationship between strategic leadership and innovation.
In fact, local corporate-governance regimes differ substantially
in ways that affect boards' discretion and legal obligations
(Jungmann, 2006). Scholars might also investigate how directors'
affiliations with educational institutions or other organizations affect
innovation outcomes across countries owing to a differential influence
of such affiliations on director status (Johnson, Schnatterly, Bolton, &
Tuggle, 2011).
Moreover, most researchers study multi-industry samples of
large, publicly listed firms. Although some find systematic differences
in relationships between strategic leaders and innovation when comparing
low- and high-tech industries (Srivastava & Lee, 2005), scholars
could investigate other aspects of the industry context. For example,
the effects of educational background or diversity among strategic
leaders might differ between environments that diverge in technology
or capital intensity, as they require different skills and capabilities.
Scholars could also attempt to reveal idiosyncrasies in the relationship
between strategic leaders and innovation in small and medium-sized
firms (e.g., Alexiev, Jansen, Bosch, & Volberda, 2010; Lefebvre,
Mason, & Lefebvre, 1997; Qian, Wang, Geng, & Yu, 2017).
4.5 | Measurement of technological innovation
We identify several particularly important issues related to the measurement
of technological innovation. About two-thirds of the papers
in our sample use R&D investments, R&D intensity, or patent-based

constructs to measure innovation. Not only are such measures relatively
easy to retrieve, replicate, and compare across studies
(R. Adams, Bessant, & Phelps, 2006; Hall, Jaffe, & Trajtenberg, 2001;
Lerner & Seru, 2017), but they are also recognized as reasonable indicators
for firm innovation (Hagedoorn & Cloodt, 2003). However,
some scholars suggest that reliance on these R&D-related measures
(R. Adams, Bessant, & Phelps, 2006) and firm patent counts (Hall,
Jaffe, & Trajtenberg, 2005; Trajtenberg, 1990) as proxies for firms'
innovation activities may not be unproblematic. Therefore, we see
several research opportunities.
First, scholars should make wider use of alternative measures of
innovation input and output. With regard to the former, R. Adams
et al. (2006) suggested developing measures that capture tacit input,
such as skills and knowledge. Such measures could focus on firms' collaborations
with researchers or research institutions, or on the educational
background and work experience of firms' R&D staff. With
respect to innovation output, scholars should utilize recent developments
in text-mining and data-mining techniques to develop more
nuanced measures of innovation output. For example, scholars could
try to capture the public's perceptions of firms' innovativeness
through semantic analyses of press coverage (Graf-Vlachy, Oliver,
Banfield, König, & Bundy, 2020), sentiment analyses of social media
data (Gautam & Yadav, 2014), or analyses of company rankings
(e.g., Forbes, 2018). Alternative ways of determining the quantity and
quality of newly developed products, services, and processes could
include systematic analyses of trademark filings (Castaldi, 2020), the
content and structure of company websites (Mironczuk &
Protasiewicz, 2020) or mission statements (Hanisch, Haeussler,
Graf-Vlachy, König, & Cho, 2018), firms' 10-K filings (Hoberg &
Phillips, 2016), or analyst reports (Bellstam, Bhagat, &
Cookson, 2020). Finally, other output-oriented measures could target
process innovations, which have rarely been considered in the extant
literature (Haneda & Ito, 2018; Qian, Cao, & Takeuchi, 2013;
Swink, 2000).
Second, we contend that R&D-based and patent-based measures
are still useful for improving our understanding of firms' innovation
activities (Hagedoorn & Cloodt, 2003). Nevertheless, we call for
greater statistical care with regard to R&D-based measures. The
majority of scholars analyze standardized R&D investments
(e.g., Heyden, Reimer, & van Doorn, 2017; Kor, 2006). However, using
ratios as dependent or independent variables might result in
inaccurate parameter estimates (Certo, Busenbark, Kalm, &
LePine, 2020). Therefore, we suggest that scholars use unscaled R&D
investments and control for the scaling factors when measuring
innovation input.
With regard to patent-based measures, it likely makes sense to
use citation-based measures of innovation output, at least in addition
to simple patent counts (Hall, Jaffe, & Trajtenberg, 2005;
Trajtenberg, 1990). Scholars should consider several aspects to ensure
empirical validity and allow for comparisons across studies. Some
studies include self-citations (e.g., Hirshleifer, Low, & Teoh, 2012),
whereas others explicitly exclude such citations (e.g., Faleye, Kovacs, &
Venkateswaran, 2014). As Sunder et al. (2017) pointed out, there
might be systematic differences among firms that do or do not cite
their own patents. Therefore, we suggest that scholars analyze
patent citations both ways. In addition, researchers must address
the data-truncation problem, which occurs because newer patents
are likely to have fewer forward citations than older patents
(Hall, Jaffe, & Trajtenberg, 2005). Moreover, researchers must
account for differences across technology fields and industries with
regard to the propensity to patent (Lerner & Seru, 2017). Most
studies in our sample use Hall et al.'s (2001, 2005) adjustment
approach (e.g., Custódio, Ferreira, & Matos, 2019; Faleye, Hoitash, &
Hoitash, 2011). However, Lerner and Seru (2017) demonstrated
that this approach can be problematic. They propose an adapted
method that uses patents of publicly traded firms instead of the
entire population of patents to adjust for truncation, and they show
that this method alleviates at least some of the problems. They also
provide a comprehensive checklist for researchers planning to
analyze patent data.
Notably, patent-based innovation measures have moved
beyond simply counting citations and patent grants (Savage, Li,
Turner, Hatfield, & Cardinal, 2020). Several promising approaches
may help link firms' technological innovations to strategic leadership
characteristics. One possibility is to make use of text-mining techniques
by, for instance, comparing patents or patent portfolios.
Analyses of textual similarity between patents can be used to track
knowledge flows and knowledge spillovers (Arts, Cassiman, &
Gomez, 2018; No, An, & Park, 2015). Other options are to measure
the novelty of innovations using semantic analyses of patents
(Gerken & Moehrle, 2012) or to examine the inventors listed in the
firms' patents, for example, to measure human capital quality based
on the citations their patents attract (Byun, Oh, & Xia, 2020) or to
analyze inventor mobility between organizations (Melero, Palomeras,
& Wehrheim, 2020). Finally, scholars could further investigate
the circumstances under which firms patent more novel
innovations by analyzing the technology classes of patents
(Balsmeier, Fleming, & Manso, 2017; Cho & Kim, 2017) or the
degree to which firms cite scientific papers in their patents
(Makri & Scandura, 2010).
Third, scholars can investigate aspects besides innovation input
and output. Few studies examine the relationship between strategic
leaders and innovation processes (e.g., Kemper, Schilke, &
Brettel, 2013; Kleinschmidt, Brentani, & Salomo, 2007;
Swink, 2000), and we have a limited understanding of the factors
that allow firms to successfully transform innovation input into output
(Duran, Kammerlander, van Essen, & Zellweger, 2016). Future
studies could develop measures that will enhance our understanding
of how strategic leaders affect innovation processes. With respect
to the intraorganizational innovation context, studies to date have
merely investigated the ways in which strategic leadership characteristics
affect the TMT's influence on innovation (e.g., Elenkov,
Judge, & Wright, 2005; Hoffman & Hegarty, 1993). Scholars could
extend this logic to the board and analyze the link between specific
board characteristics and the board's effect on innovation
outcomes.

4.6 | Other methodological issues
Rich and promising avenues for future research also arise from other
methodological issues, especially endogeneity and mediation analyses.
4.6.1 | Endogeneity
Accounting for endogeneity in strategic leadership research is “essential
for gaining a grasp of the causal mechanisms that lie behind
empirical associations” (Hambrick, 2007, p. 338). Aside from measurement
error and simultaneity, the key sources of endogeneity in strategic
leadership research are omitted variables (Bascle, 2008). In
particular, TMT and board member selection are unlikely to be
exogenous. The attractiveness of a firm to a strategic leader and the
selection of strategic leaders are affected by firm characteristics and
prior firm decisions (R. B. Adams, Hermalin, & Weisbach, 2010;
Hambrick, 2007). Therefore, any relationship between strategic leadership
characteristics and innovation outcomes might be caused by
the same hard-to-observe factors that determine board and TMT
composition.
Owing to the importance of endogeneity for strategic leadership
research, we analyzed how the research in our sample addressed this
issue. We built on the main sources of endogeneity outlined by
Antonakis et al. (2010) to derive keywords referring to endogeneity.2
We then read the method and results sections of all articles that contained
at least one of these keywords. Figure 4 shows the main
results.
The figure highlights the number of papers that methodologically
address endogeneity concerns, name endogeneity as a potential limitation
when interpreting the results, or do not explicitly address the
issue. As illustrated, a number of studies in our sample, especially the
earlier ones, do not explicitly account for endogeneity
(e.g., Calantone, Vickery, & Dröge, 1995; Hoffman & Hegarty, 1993).
If they address endogeneity at all, most studies before 2004 only state
that potential endogenous effects should be considered in the interpretation
of the results (e.g., Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Hoskisson, Hitt,
Johnson, & Grossman, 2002). However, most of the recent studies
methodologically address endogeneity (e.g., Ammann, Horsch, &
Oesch, 2016; Sunder, Sunder, & Zhang, 2017).
We also found that the quantitative methods used to address
endogeneity have evolved over time. Whereas earlier studies often
used simple approaches, such as lagging variables or conducting additional
subgroup analyses as indicators for causal relationships
(e.g., Barker & Mueller, 2002; Deutsch, 2007), recent studies employ
more sophisticated methods, such as incorporating fixed effects
(e.g., Ammann, Horsch, & Oesch, 2016; Makri, Lane, & Gomez-
Mejia, 2006), employing two-stage analyses (e.g., Gerstner, König,
Enders, & Hambrick, 2013; Maula, Keil, & Zahra, 2013), or using suitable
instrument variables (e.g., Chemmanur, Kong, Krishnan, &
Yu, 2019; Kini & Williams, 2012). In addition, some scholars use matched
sample approaches (e.g., Ammann, Horsch, & Oesch, 2016;
Cremers, Litov, & Sepe, 2017) or examine changes in innovation outcomes
after exogenous events, such as exogenous executive turnover
(e.g., Balsam, Puthenpurackal, & Upadhyay, 2016; Cummings &
Knott, 2018) and regulatory changes (e.g., Balsmeier, Fleming, &
Manso, 2017; Mao & Zhang, 2018) or shocks, such as terrorist attacks
and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy (Hutton, Jiang, & Kumar, 2014).
In fact, recent papers often employ multiple methods to address
endogeneity. For example, Cremers et al. (2017) considered alternative
explanatory variables for their dependent and independent variables
to reduce potential bias from omitted variables, analyzed
multiple matched samples, employed instruments by using the
dynamic generalized method of moments estimator, and further
examined the effects of an exogenous regulatory change during the
observation period.
We strongly advise scholars to use appropriate methods to
address endogeneity. Research designs should be constructed to
avoid endogeneity from the outset. For instance, longitudinal
research designs may be helpful when using archival data

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
(Hamilton & Nickerson, 2003), and key variables should be measured
at different points in time or from different informants in
survey-based research. For example, in their survey-based study,
Mihalache et al. (2012) collected data for the dependent variables
1 year after collecting data for the independent variables. In addition,
scholars could consider using experimental research designs to
infer causation. Notably, in our sample, only Rose et al. (2014) conducted
an experiment.
Statistical techniques should also be used to account for endogeneity.
Whenever possible, scholars should control for potentially
confounding variables (Certo, Withers, & Semadeni, 2017). For example,
Custódio et al. (2019) used both firm fixed and firm-CEO fixed
effects to analyze the impact of CEO managerial skills on innovation
output. Heckman-type two-stage models can be helpful in cases of
(self-)selection (e.g., when only firms that engage in a certain innovation
practice can be observed; Certo, Busenbark, Woo, &
Semadeni, 2016; Clougherty, Duso, & Muck, 2016). Instrumentalvariable
approaches are likely to be the most broadly applicable solution
to endogeneity (Hamilton & Nickerson, 2003). Although it can be
challenging to find strong and valid instruments (Bascle, 2008), a substantial
number of recent studies successfully use them to deal with
endogeneity problems (e.g., Chen, Miller, & Chen, 2019; Custódio,
Ferreira, & Matos, 2019; Oh & Barker, 2018). For instance, Bernile
et al. (2018) measured the relationship between board diversity and
innovation outcomes. As their main instrumental variable, they capture
the diversity of potential nonlocal directors. Souder and
Bromiley (2017) employed five instrumental variables reflecting firmlevel
compensation policies that are correlated with the potentially
endogenous explanatory variables based on TMT stock options. For a
particularly detailed discussion and statistical analysis of potential
endogenous effects in the relationship between strategic leadership
and technological innovation, we refer to Custódio et al. (2019) or
Cremers et al. (2017). Notably, both the improved methods for dealing
with endogeneity and the relative silence on endogeneity in earlier
research create ample opportunities for replication research to ensure
that the field's extant findings are robust (Bettis, Helfat, &
Shaver, 2016).
4.6.2 | Mediation analysis
Our results show a pressing need to better understand the processes
that mediate strategic leadership and innovation outcomes—the proverbial
“black box” of strategic leadership research (Lawrence, 1997).
In fact, the extant research rarely includes mediation analyses of
mechanisms involving the CEO (e.g., Chen, Tang, Jin, Xie, & Li, 2014)
or the TMT (e.g., Ou, Waldman, & Peterson, 2018), and most studies
on boards to date essentially only analyze the relationship between
board composition and technological innovation. Therefore, especially
regarding board research, a better understanding of behavioral or
collaboration-related variables as well as board processes and dynamics
is desirable. For example, future research could build on the initial
qualitative research on boards in the context of innovation
(Hoppmann, Naegele, & Girod, 2019; Morais, Kakabadse, &
Kakabadse, 2019) to deduce potentially relevant mediating factors.
4.7 | Current trends in innovation research
Finally, several innovation topics appear relevant in relation to
strategic leadership. First, digital technological innovation is reshaping
entire industries, economies, and societies (Bankewitz, Aberg, &
Teuchert, 2016; Nylén & Holmström, 2015). Although this technological
discontinuity can destroy incumbent firms' core competencies
(Anderson & Tushman, 1990) and drastically alter their strategic contexts
(Bankewitz, Aberg, & Teuchert, 2016), it can also be an opportunity
(Furr & Shipilov, 2019) if strategic leaders are able to adapt their
mental models (Tripsas & Gavetti, 2000) and acquire the necessary
resources and competencies (Loucks, Macaulay, Noronha, &
Wade, 2016). As digital transformation is now a central theme on strategic
leaders' agendas (Warner & Wäger, 2019) and as its consequences
are contingent on the capabilities of strategic leaders (Kor &
Mesko, 2013), there are numerous research opportunities. For one,
scholars might study how strategic leaders react to digital innovations.
For instance, researchers could investigate the individual and interactive
roles of leaders in the identification, adoption, and management
of digital technologies in organizations (Hesse, 2018; Warner &
Wäger, 2019) or study how prior experiences and cognitions of strategic
leaders, their social ties, and board and TMT configurations foster
these processes (Cortellazzo, Bruni, & Zampieri, 2019). For
another, digital technologies are likely to result in changes in the composition,
ways of working, and cognition of strategic leaders
(Bankewitz, Aberg, & Teuchert, 2016).
Second, digitalization may have broader consequences that need
to be addressed in the context of corporate governance and strategic
leadership. For instance, digital technologies may result in a shift from
centralized and hierarchical organizational forms towards more collective
forms of decision making characterized by decentralization and
disintermediation (Fenwick & Vermeulen, 2019). Scholars might ponder
how this requires adaptations of established forms of corporate
governance. In this regard, artificial intelligence (AI) requires particular
attention. Machines often achieve greater decision quality than
humans, especially in complex situations characterized by an abundance
of data, such as director selection (Erel, Stern, Chenhao, &
Weisbach, 2018; Jarrahi, 2018). Furthermore, companies such as the
Finnish software company Tieto have begun to appoint AI “members”
to their leadership teams (Tieto, 2016). Although such decisions are
met with skepticism and amusement by commentators, they highlight
the need to align data-driven decision-making processes with classic
models of corporate governance focused on people and accountability
(Fenwick & Vermeulen, 2019). Further advances in machine learning
(Jarrahi, 2018) also call for research on the possibilities for and consequences
of deeper integration of AI as both a governing element and
an element to be governed (Raisch & Krakowski, 2020).
Third, sustainability-related business practices are increasingly
important for firms (Klewitz & Hansen, 2014). Technological
454 KURZHALS ET AL.
14678683, 2020, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/corg.12351 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
innovation is likely to play a key role in enabling such practices
(Fagerberg, 2018), and strategic leadership naturally influences their
adoption (Rego, Cunha, & Polónia, 2017). However, we know little
about whether and how anchoring sustainability in the TMT or the
board affects firms' innovation processes. In particular, sustainable
innovation practices require a shift of attention from economic performance
towards environmental and social aspects (Wiengarten,
Lo, & Lam, 2017). To achieve this shift, boards may need to reconsider
CEO and TMT incentives. In this regard, future research can provide
guidance on which incentives and performance indicators are most
suitable for encouraging sustainable innovation processes and the
development of sustainable products and services.
Finally, we see research opportunities in the fields of user innovation
and open innovation, both of which differ from traditional,
producer-focused innovation (Baldwin & Hippel, 2011). In user innovation,
those using products, services, or processes are the source of
innovations (Baldwin & Hippel, 2011). Open innovation is a “distributed
innovation process that relies on purposively managed knowledge
flows across organizational boundaries” (Chesbrough, 2017,
p. 35), which includes opening firms' innovation processes to external
knowledge sources (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke, & West, 2006). Both
types of innovation require revisiting established knowledgemanagement
and product- and service-development practices
(Baldwin & Hippel, 2011). As such, they force strategic leaders to substantially
adapt their mental models and behaviors. This creates a
need to study, for example, the relationship between strategic leaders'
collaboration activities inside and outside the organization and user
and open innovation. Researchers could also analyze how strategic
leaders of incumbent firms simultaneously manage traditional and
open innovation models to identify the related challenges and examine
the types, constellations, and capabilities of strategic leaders that
are most beneficial in such contexts (Altman & Tushman, 2017).
5 | PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Our findings also have important implications for practitioners. First,
our overview of the relationships between CEO characteristics and
innovation outcomes provides board members with guidance for
selecting a CEO who can successfully manage innovation given the
firm's circumstances. For example, directors should carefully evaluate
the potential CEO's educational background (e.g., Barker &
Mueller, 2002), prior work experience (e.g., Deeds, DeCarolis, &
Coombs, 2000), and other directorships (Oh & Barker, 2018), as these
factors can affect the candidate's innovation decisions. In addition,
boards need to consider environmental aspects, such as environmental
dynamism (Nadkarni & Chen, 2014; Wu, Levitas, & Priem, 2005),
as well as organizational aspects, such as the firm's experience with
strategic alliances (Tyler & Steensma, 1998), as these factors
moderate the relationship between CEO characteristics and innovation
outcomes.
Second, the research summarized here provides boards with guidance
regarding the use of managerial compensation to motivate the
TMT to focus on long-term firm outcomes. Some examples include
using stock options to mitigate CEOs' career-horizon issues
(Zona, 2016) and focusing on long-term TMT compensation elements
to foster innovation (Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, & Thakor, 2014).
Third, as our research comprehensively describes the individualand
group-level effects of board characteristics on technological innovation,
it can help shareholders with the challenging task of choosing
appropriate directors given the organization's circumstances and the
board's current composition. For example, if investors wish to
increase the firm's patenting activity, they could consider selecting
outside board members with experience in the focal innovation field.
Moreover, they may wish to increase the number of directors from
ethnic minorities to enhance the firm's innovation output (Cook &
Glass, 2015).
6 | LIMITATIONS
Our literature review has several limitations. First, we necessarily
focused on a limited set of the most relevant journals. Naturally, there
might be additional research on strategic leadership and innovation in
other outlets. Second, the results of our review are based on a sample
determined by a specific set of keywords. Although we followed an
established and systematic process (David & Han, 2004; Rousseau,
Manning, & Denyer, 2008) and although the large number of identified
studies suggests that we cover a substantial section of the focal
topic, the results are limited by the scope of the chosen keywords.
Third, we deliberately excluded studies focusing on young firms. Thus,
researchers might wish to review the literature dealing with strategic
leadership in the context of young firms to examine how this specific
context affects the relationship between strategic leaders and innovation.
Finally, we focused on technological innovation. Future research
could review other forms of innovation, such as administrative, ancillary,
or business-model innovation (Damanpour, 1987; Osiyevskyy &
Dewald, 2015).
7 | CONCLUSION
In this interdisciplinary review, we aimed to unveil the relationship
between strategic leadership and technological innovation. We not
only summarized important aspects of this relationship but also
stressed the need to extend this line of research. Beyond suggesting
that researchers consider a wider range of theoretical approaches, our
discussion of potential avenues for future research highlighted the
fact that the role of the board of directors in innovation outcomes
needs more attention. Moreover, our review reveals a need to better
understand the impact of innovation on strategic leadership. Scholars
should also exploit novel research settings in order to illuminate additional
facets of the relationship between strategic leaders and innovation,
and they need to ensure consistency and care in the
measurement of innovation. To date, scholarship has led to the accumulation
of a broad body of valuable knowledge on the relationship

between strategic leadership and innovation. We are optimistic that
our review will enable researchers to make even better use of this
knowledge and further advance this promising field of research.

NOTES
1 Such monitoring activities might also offset the negative relationship
between the outsider ratio and R&D investments (Deutsch, 2005). In
this regard, Deutsch (2005) cautioned that the relationship between
board composition and risk reduction might stem from reverse causality.
Firms with CEOs who underinvest in R&D may be in greater need of a
vigilant board and, thus, seek a higher share of outside directors. However,
this explanation might contradict more recent findings indicating
that firms with increasing R&D intensity are more likely to appoint an
outside director as the board chairperson, thereby increasing board
vigilance (Balsam, Puthenpurackal, & Upadhyay, 2016).
